        <h2>Shortest Job First (SJF) CPU Scheduling Algorithm</h2>
        <!-- Content for SJF page -->
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <div class="box1 box">

            <p>The shortest job first (SJF) or shortest job next, is a scheduling policy that selects the waiting
                process with the smallest execution time to execute next.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Characteristics of SJF Scheduling</h3>
        <div class="box2 box">


            <ul>
                <li>Shortest Job first has the advantage of having a minimum average waiting time FCFS scheduling
                    algorithms.
                </li>
                <li>It may cause starvation if shorter processes keep coming.
                </li>
                <li>It is practically infeasible as Operating System may not know burst times and therefore may not sort
                    them. While it is not possible to predict execution time, several methods can be used to estimate
                    the execution time for a job, such as a weighted average of previous execution times.
                </li>
                <li>SJF can be used in specialized environments where accurate estimates of running time are available.
                </li>
                <li>It is non preemptive, once a process is selected it run until it is blocked for an I/O or some other
                    event or it is terminated.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Algorithm</h3>
        <div class="box3 box">


            <ul>
                <li>Sort all the processes according to the arrival time.
                </li>
                <li>Then select that process that has minimum arrival time and minimum Burst time.
                </li>
                <li>After completion of the process make a pool of processes that arrives afterward till the completion
                    of the previous process and select that process among the pool which is having minimum Burst time.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Process Scheduling Variables </h3>
        <div class="box4 box">

            <ol>
                <li>Process ID: This variable uniquely identifies each process in the system. It serves as a unique
                    identifier for each process.
                </li>
                <li>Arrival Time: This variable represents the time at which a process arrives in the ready queue,
                    indicating when the process becomes available for execution.
                </li>
                <li>Burst Time: This variable indicates the amount of time required by a process to complete its
                    execution once it begins running on the CPU. It represents the duration of CPU time needed by the
                    process.
                </li>
                <li>Completion Time: This variable denotes the time at which the execution of a process completes. It
                    signifies when the process finishes its execution and is ready to leave the system.
                </li>
                <li>Turnaround Time: This variable measures the total time taken by a process from its arrival in the
                    system to its completion, including both the waiting time in the ready queue and the execution time
                    on the CPU. It represents the total time a process spends in the system.
                </li>
                <li>Waiting Time: This variable represents the total time a process spends waiting in the ready queue,
                    i.e., the time elapsed from when the process arrives until it begins its execution on the CPU. It
                    quantifies the time a process remains in the ready queue before it gets CPU execution time.

        <div class="box6 box">

            <ul>
                <li>SJF is better than the First come first serve (FCFS) algorithm as it reduces the average waiting
                    time.
                </li>
                <li>SJF is generally used for long term scheduling.
                </li>
                <li>It is suitable for the jobs running in batches, where run times are already known.

        <div class="box3 box">
            <ul>
                <li>Deadlock Possibility: This solution may still suffer from deadlock if all philosophers
                    simultaneously pick up their left chopstick and wait indefinitely for the right one, leading to a
                    deadlock situation.
                </li>
                <li>Starvation: There's a possibility of starvation where a philosopher might not get access to both
                    chopsticks if other philosophers consistently prioritize one of the chopsticks, preventing fair
                    access to resources.
                </li>
                <li>Unequal Access: The solution doesn't ensure equal access to resources for all philosophers, as some
                    may have better chances of acquiring both chopsticks compared to others.
                </li>
                <li>Complexity: Implementing and managing the solution can be complex, especially in distributed or
                    multi-threaded environments, potentially leading to synchronization issues and bugs.
                </li>
                <li>Resource Waste: In cases where philosophers hold onto chopsticks for extended periods without
                    eating, resources may be wasted unnecessarily, reducing overall system efficiency.

        <h2>C-LOOK Disk Scheduling Algorithm</h2>
<div class="box">
    <p>C-LOOK Disk Scheduling Algorithm is an enhanced version of both SCAN as well as LOOK disk scheduling algorithms. This algorithm also uses the idea of wrapping the tracks as a circular cylinder as the C-SCAN Algorithm but the seek time is better than the C-SCAN algorithm. We know that C-SCAN is used to avoid starvation and services all the requests more uniformly, the same goes for C-LOOK. </p>

  <p>In this algorithm, the head services request only in one direction(either left or right) until all the requests in this direction are not serviced and then jumps back to the farthest request in the other direction and services the remaining requests which gives a better uniform servicing as well as avoids wasting seek time for going till the end of the disk.</p>
</div>
<h2>Algorithm</h2>
<div class="box">
    <pre>
Step 1: Let the Request array represents an array storing indexes of the tracks that have been requested in ascending order of their time of arrival and the head is the position of the disk head.
Step 2: The initial direction in which the head is moving is given and it services in the same direction.
Step 3: The head services all the requests one by one in the direction it is moving.
Step 4: The head continues to move in the same direction until all the requests in this direction have been serviced.
Step 5: While moving in this direction, calculate the absolute distance of the tracks from the head.
Step 6: Increment the total seek count with this distance.
Step 7: Currently serviced track position now becomes the new head position.
Step 8: Go to step 5 until we reach the last request in this direction.
Step 9: If we reach the last request in the current direction then reverse the direction and move the head in this direction until we reach the last request that is needed to be serviced in this direction without servicing the intermediate requests.
Step 10: Reverse the direction and go to step 3 until all the requests have not been serviced.

            <ul>
                <li>Page replacement algorithms manage memory efficiently in operating systems, particularly in virtual

                <li>They determine which pages stay in physical memory and which are temporarily stored on disk.</li>
                <li>These algorithms optimize memory utilization by prioritizing actively used pages while minimizing
                    unnecessary page swaps.</li>
                <li>By reducing page faults, they improve system performance and responsiveness.</li>
                <li>Page replacement algorithms also ensure fair access to memory resources among competing processes,
                    promoting system stability.</li>
                <li>Page replacement algorithms play a crucial role in enhancing system performance by reducing the

        <h3>Define FIFO Page Replacement Algorithm</h3>
        <div class="box2 box">
            <ul>
                This is the simplest page replacement algorithm. In this algorithm, the operating system keeps track of
                all pages in the memory in a queue, the oldest page is in the front of the queue. When a page needs to
                be replaced page in the front of the queue is selected for removal.
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Algorithm</h3>
        <div class="box3 box">
            <ul>
                <li>FIFO treats memory like a first-in, first-out queue.
                </li>
                <li>Pages are loaded into available frames (sections of RAM) as needed.
                </li>
                <li>When a page fault occurs and there are no empty frames, the oldest page (the one at the front of the
                    queue) is evicted from memory to make space for the new page.
                </li>

        <h3>Advantages:</h3>
        <div class="box5 box">
            <ul>
                <li>Simplicity: FIFO is incredibly easy to understand and implement. It treats memory like a
                    first-in, first-out queue, making the logic straightforward.</li>
                <li>Fairness: Every page gets an equal chance. Pages are evicted based on their arrival time,
                    preventing any bias towards specific pages.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
        <div class="box6 box">
            <ul>
                <li>Poor Performance for Unpredictable Access Patterns: If the program's memory access patterns are
                    unpredictable, FIFO might not be optimal. It could evict frequently used pages, leading to more
                    page faults and slower execution.</li>
                <li>Belady's Anomaly: This is a critical drawback. In certain reference strings, increasing the
                    number of available frames (memory) using FIFO can lead to more page faults. This
                    counter-intuitive behavior happens because FIFO doesn't consider future page accesses. A
                    recently used page might be evicted even if it's needed again soon.</li>
